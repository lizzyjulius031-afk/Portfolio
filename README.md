# Portfolio
I am a frontend web developer specializing in building clean, responsive, and user‑friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have experience developing business blogs, personal portfolios, and contact‑enabled websites. I am seeking remote or international where I can contribute to real‑world projects and continue growing professionally.
